# AI_Agent

This repository contains code and resources for developing an AI agent.

## Overview

This project aims to create an autonomous AI agent capable of searching in the web or in wikipedia and make a research report on the topic provided by the user. The core development is done within a Jupyter Notebook, allowing for interactive experimentation and development.

## Contents

* `AI_Agent.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the AI agent.
* `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the code.
* `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git.
